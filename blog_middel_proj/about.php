          About the pharmacy

        </h1>
        <p class="text-white ">The Honest Apothecary is about the profession of pharmacy, pharmacy careers, pharmacy-related interviews, and pretty much anything related to…well….pharmacy. My name is Jason Poquette. I’m a pharmacist. Welcome to my blog.
          <br>
          I call this site the “Honest” apothecary. Not that those other pharmacists are dishonest! We are still, due to no special efforts on my part, one of the more trusted professions in society. I am personally grateful to the many excellent pharmacy blogs being written today. But I chose the word honest because of Noah Webster’s beautiful definition of honesty in his dictionary published in 1828: “In principle, an upright disposition; moral rectitude of heart; a disposition to conform to justice and correct moral principles in all social transactions.” I therefore put that word “honest” not so much before YOUR eyes, as MINE, as a constant reminder of what I strive to be.</p>
